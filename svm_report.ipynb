    "\n",
    "Every transaction, interaction, and scenario generates new information, or *data*. The creation of data is a continuous process. In light of this fact and the advances in computing technology over the past few decades, machine learning has emerged as a popular field of study. With machine learning, we can analyze and make use of historical data collected from our pasts to provide new, useful information that can influence our futures. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models can be divided into two broad categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. With supervised learning models, we start with a collection of $n$ observations that each include a set of $i$ independent variables ($x_i\\in X$) and the actual value of the independent variable $Y$ we are interested in predicting. This collection of observations with known $Y$ values is used to train and validate a learning model that can be used to predict $Y$ for new observations where it is not known. In unsupervised learning, we seek to achieve a good representation of the domain space covered by our training samples and learn about the structure of our data, rather than predict some variable $Y$ or label for a new observation.\n",

    "$$w_0 = b, w_1 = m$$\n",
    "$$x_0 = 1, x_1 = x_1$$\n",
    "$$y = w_1(x_1) + w_0(1)$$\n",
    "$$  = w_1(x_1) + w_0$$\n",

    "A line in n-dimensional space would have $n-1$ independent variables. Our formula would then be:\n",

Given a set of observations, a linear regression model will determine the best values of $\\theta_0, \\theta_1 ... \\theta_n$ that produce the line of best fit. Then, given a new observation $X$ with independent variables $a_1, a_2...a_n$, the predicted $Y$ value will be the $y$ value on the line of best fit where $x_1 = a_1, x_2 = a_2 ... = x_n = a_n$. \n",
